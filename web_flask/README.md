7. improve engines 
Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:

Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present

If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State

8.  list of states
Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:

Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present

If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State

9. Cities by states
Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/cities_by_states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B> + UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py
